    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess. I came up with this oven-fried version, and have been making it ever since! Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well.</p>
    <p>Cut down on oil by making "fried" chicken in the oven. This oven-fried chicken recipe, made with simple ingredients you probably already have on hand, is as good as it gets.</p>
